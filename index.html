<section id="tribute-info">
  <p>The Land Rover Defender is one of the most iconic vehicles of all time. Over 2 million were built between 1947 and 2016. Due to its use on numerous expeditions across the world it was the first vehicle 60% of people in the developing world ever saw. The Land Rover is still used across the world for its rugged off-road capabilities but has also become somewhat of a collectors item with some examples costing upwards of Â£100 000. <br>
<br>
    I owned a Defender a few years ago, they are not a luxurious vehicle, they are not fast and they are definitely not economical, but they do provide a sense of adventure with every journey (as long as it starts that is). </p>
